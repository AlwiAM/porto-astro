## Why I Chose Astro.js

After exploring various frameworks and static site generators, I decided to build my portfolio using Astro.js. Here's why:

### Performance First

Astro's approach to shipping zero JavaScript by default was a game-changer. My portfolio loads incredibly fast, with minimal JavaScript being sent to the browser.

### TypeScript Support

Built-in TypeScript support with strict mode enabled helps catch errors early and provides excellent developer experience with autocomplete and type checking.

### Component Islands

Astro's island architecture allows me to use interactive components only where needed, like my AI chatbot, while keeping the rest of the site static.

## Key Features Implemented

1. **Dark Mode Toggle** - Smooth theme switching with localStorage persistence
2. **AI Chatbot** - RAG-based assistant powered by Groq API
3. **Contact Form** - Functional email integration with EmailJS
4. **Responsive Design** - Mobile-first approach with modern CSS

## Lessons Learned

Building this portfolio taught me the importance of:

- **Clean Architecture** - Separating data, components, and layouts
- **Performance Optimization** - Using static site generation for speed
- **User Experience** - Implementing smooth animations and transitions
- **Accessibility** - Semantic HTML and ARIA labels

## What's Next?

I'm planning to add more features:

- Blog section with MDX support (currently implementing!)
- Advanced animations with View Transitions
- PWA capabilities for offline support
- Analytics integration

Stay tuned for more updates!
